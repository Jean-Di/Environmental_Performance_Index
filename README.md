# Environmental_Performance_Index
The aim of this project is to analyse the performance of selected countries using a composite Environmental Index.
The assessment will focus on the year 2020, with a comparative analysis spanning 2000 to 2020 to identify trends in climate and renewable energy 
performance. Based on this evaluation, the study will provide policy recommendations to guide future sustainable efforts, tailored to each countryâ€™s progress and challenges.
